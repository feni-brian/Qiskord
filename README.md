-------------------------------------

## Introduction

Text messaging, voice calls, video calls, media and file sharing, and instant messaging are all possible on the **Qiskord** social messaging and VoIP platform. Private or public communication can occur in online groups known as "servers." A server is a group of voice channels and live chat rooms that are accessible through invite links. Users may also group themselves into topic-based channels for sharing and cooperation.

To sum up, **Qiskord** is the app where you may hang out with a small group of pals. A online hub that facilitates daily conversation and increased social interaction.
